# Project Title

Compression Suite (WIP)

## Description
An application that performs various compression techniques like encrypting/decrypting sources using different algorithms and methods. Also has some tools for checking properties of codebooks. This project was started as supplemental exercise to CpE 405: Information Coding Systems.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

If you would like to run the scripts separately and manually configure I/O sources then a working installation of python is mostly all you need. Certain methods may import at most one common library. Check documentation as necessary.

It is not recommended to run GUI.py, rather use the executable (WIP).

*### Installing
